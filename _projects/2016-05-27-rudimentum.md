It has always been mankind’s greatest goal to seek what lies beyond the Earth. There has always been a theory that it would be possible to create a colony for humans on Mars, and in believing so, we have designed just such a colony.

The brief stipulated the creation of a colony for 40 humans, who would be pioneers of human civilization on Mars. The design that we have come up with is compliant with the extreme natural conditions of mars.

To create a properly oxygenated atmosphere, an artificial shell has been created, which is sealed on the inside. This will allow for artificial oxygenation.

The problem of sand accumulation can be solved by using a double layered aerodynamic dome with vibrators placed between them which automatically cleans off the dust by lateral vibration.
