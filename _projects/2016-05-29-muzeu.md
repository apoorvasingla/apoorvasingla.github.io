**Project**- Studio Design, Semester 9

**Area**- 28360 sq.m.

**Location**- Jawahar Circle, Jaipur

**Contribution**- Individual Work

Govt. of Rajasthan has proposed a Gol market on a stretch of width 35M around Jawahar Circle, Jaipur on the same concept of Connaught place, New Delhi.

The tourists who comes all the way from an another country should have the feeling of revisiting Jaipur, so making a backdrop of buildings which completes the overview. Therefore, there is a need of such a building which relates itself to the IMAGE OF THE CITY.

A Museum-cum-Interpretation Centre, a museum of traditional arts and crafts of Jaipur can serve the purpose by providing necessary information to the tourists and building an IMAGE of the Jaipur City.

Focus is given on the form of the museum building to make it an iconic and attractive structure from distance. A form which follows Golden Ration in 3-dimensions is built as the main museum building. It is similar to structure of a shell which is an organic form. The entrance building is also in the form of a laid flower which opens towards the visitors.
