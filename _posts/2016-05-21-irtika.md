**Project**- Annual NASA Design Competition, 14

**Location**- Jaleb Chowk, Jaipur

**Contribution**- Group work (Designing, Drawings, Research, Sheet Composition)

ARCHITECTURAL SENSITIZATION- an observation . . . .

The idea is to create a project within the modern context with due respect and acknowledgment of the old.

*Emphasis on RE-search and NOT research.*

Our ancestors built better with their effort and technologies/ techniques that they had. They used their common sense to understand material and constructed the grandest structures ever.

The objective was not to criticize the new styles of architecture but to look into the common sensitive approach in architecture to achieve an outcome with relevance to the city’s overall context, growth dynamics, location, architectural sensitivity, technological advancements and availability of resources.
