**Project**- Thesis Project

**Location**- Udaipur

**Area**- 100m x 100m 

**Contribution**- Individual Work

The design intention was to create a residence that uses barrier-free architecture as one of the important feature as the younger child of the family is physically disabled.

Basic concept of design is to use different forms in planning of different spaces to generate an interesting design.

Fusion of 2 basic geometric shapes i.e. circle and hexagon is used with hexagons as bedrooms and circle as living spaces. Spaces so generated are well ventilated and lightened through vertical windows provided on each facade. Cantilevered slabs are best suited as shading device or to create interesting play of light and shade in elevation.

A ramp is provided to enter in basement where an NGO operates. The foremost cylindrical space, living room, is raised on columns so as to provide light to the garden in basement. The roof of central hexagon is pitched roof with skylights on sides to provide light inside building.
